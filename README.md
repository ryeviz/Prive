# Task-Manager
The task manager built using Javascript is a console-based application that helps users manage their tasks efficiently. The program allows users to add, view, update, and delete tasks. Users can also mark tasks as completed or set due dates for tasks. The program stores the tasks in a database, which can be accessed by the user at any time.
